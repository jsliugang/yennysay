Yennysay is an open source GUI tool that can read texts using the free offline TTS engine built-in in Windows 10. 
It shows progress in the text box. You can stop it and move the cursor to another fragment.

It can automatically detect that the text is in English or Russian.
If the "Track clipboard" checkbox is selected, it automatically reads whatever is copied to the clipboard.

Moreover, if you copy the URL, it will try to get the text from that URL and read it.

I also added a special handling for YouTube URLs. Yennysay will open them in SMPLayer.
